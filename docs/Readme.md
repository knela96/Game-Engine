Welcome to Mercury engine's Github page!

Each engine must have single page website (made inside github.com) that contains:


1. Short introduction to the engine and it’s context (university subject).
[Mercury engine](https://github.com/knela96/Mercury-Engine) is a videogames engine university project for UPC-CITM. This project pretends to create an
engine witch is able to load, import and play animations from fbx models that have been animated in an external animation software such as maya, blender 
or 3DsMax. 
This s a group project by [Eric Canela Sol](https://github.com/knela96) and [Jaume Avinyó Sedano](https://github.com/Jaumeavinyo). We are third year students
in the programming and videogame developement Bachalor Degree in UPC-CITM.
