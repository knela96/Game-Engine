In dev (rev. 270)
 - 

Version 1.1.5 (svn rev. 270, 01.06.2008):
 - Task: 1929292: "Write technical documentation"
   Fully documented following files: type_manip.h, new.h,
      pointer_convert.h, size_tracking.h, heap_segment.h,
	  memory_segment.h, segment_traits.h, managed_base.h,
	  singleton_manager.h, manager_traits.h,
	  memory_manager.h and manager_category.h files
   
 - fixed code alignment in static_bitset
 - updated Doxyfile configuration
 - fixed identifiers names to match naming convention

!!!!!
 - fixed compiler errors on VC8 (VS2005)
 - Fixed issue with size_tracking decorator that brings memory corruption
 - Implemented unit test to catch memory corruptions made by size tracker decorator
 - Implemented overload of mem_mgr() function for singleton manager (to make life easier)
 - Added base_manager_type typedef to manager traits and decorator traits, this type represent manager type w/o decorator
 - renamed do_delete into delete_ and do_delete_arr into delete_array
 - improved unit tests for managed_base class, so now stored values are also checked
!!!!!

 - moved sync classes out of details namespace
 - all classes that were our of memory_mgr namespace were moved into
 - moved sync classes headers to "sync" folder
 - moved yes_type and no_type out of is_categoy_suppoted class
 - updated unit tests to use new mem_mgr function

   and for return type
 - implemented pointer traits class
 - type definitions were standardized: 
   suffix "_type" will be used in all typedefs
 - memory_manager allocate methods were re-implemented to use 
   invalid_offset as invalid result value instead of npos
 - added unit test for "no throw" memory_manager allocate operator 
 - fixed static_bitset::bit_mask(pos, count) method for case 
   when count is grater then 64 bits (int bits number)
